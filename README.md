# Inventory-Management
Inventory management software can now go several layers deep and integrate with accounting and ERP systems. 
Inventory management software is a software system for tracking inventory levels, orders, sales and deliveries.
The software also calculates the costs --often in multiple currencies -- so that accounting systems always have an accurate assessment of the value of the goods.
